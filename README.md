# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple web application that allows users to check whether a given string is a palindrome or not.

## Usage

1. Enter a string of characters in the input field.
2. Click the "Check" button.
3. The application will display whether the input string is a palindrome or not.

## What is a Palindrome?

A palindrome is a word or sentence that reads the same way forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

## How It Works

The application removes non-alphabetic characters from the input string and then checks if the resulting string is the same when read forward and backward. It disregards differences in capitalization.

## Getting Started

To use this application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the web page elements.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for checking palindromes.
